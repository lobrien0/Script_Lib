# Script_Lib
the Script Library is where all the scripts I have written go to live.

## Languages?

As times goes on I will be writing more and more scripts in different languages.  
However the primary languages will `bash` and `python`

## Can I use these scripts?

Feel free to adapt use these scripts for your own use.
